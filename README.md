# vibration-tracking-app
To design an IOS APP that can leverage existing sensors equipped on a smart phone to track vibration statistics of a road/street while driving, walking or riding a bike.
Data and statistics (e.g., distributions) are expected to be shown on a map and the route with appropriate visualization techniques, for example, in the form of color scale.
Open-source map API, such as Google Map or OpenStreet Map, can be used.
